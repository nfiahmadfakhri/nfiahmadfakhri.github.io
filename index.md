### Data Science Projects

[Project 1: Data Wrangling and Machine Learning to Identify the Key Factors Affecting Credit Card Holders' Spending Behaviour](/projects/Portfolio - Credit Card Spending Behaviour.ipynb)

This project is worked on for the purpose of self-practice to implement the knowledge on Data Science onto banking problems. The main objective of this project is to identify the main factors that affect credit card holders' spending behaviour and to predict the credit card spending limit of each customer. Data cleaning and wrangling were performed over the information obtained from 5000 credit card holders using __Python__. 

The datasets contain both numerical and categorical variables, and all variables were taken into consideration as the potential drivers that could affect the total credit card spending. Feature selection and multicollinearity handling have been performed over the datasets to reduce the number of input variables before a predictive model is developed. The datasets were fit into __Linear Regression model__ and __Random Forest Regression model__ to predict the credit card spending limit for each customer.
